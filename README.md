## Introducing VoiceLab

VoiceLab, the first AI voice-over platform on Aptos, introduced a groundbreaking idea of using digital assets (DA) called VoiceCard NFTs to store cloned voices of voiceover artists, which all information about royalties, commercial rights, and voice data are embedded inside. The combination of AI and Web 3.0 perfectly addresses the inefficiencies and accessibility issues in traditional voiceover industry, and complexity of commercial rights and ownership. Now, voiceover artists able to clone their voices and generate one-of-a-kind VoiceCard NFT collections with the VoiceLab AI Voice Engine, and receive voice royalties directly, together with the help of simple monetization tracking. Clients can freely explore the VoiceLab Marketplace, mint different VoiceCards which suits their use cases, and use them on-the-spot in the VoiceLab Studio for powerful and super natural AI speech generation via TTS (text-to-speech).
