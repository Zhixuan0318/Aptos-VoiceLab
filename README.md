## 	üëã Introducing VoiceLab

VoiceLab, the first AI voice-over platform on Aptos, introduced a groundbreaking idea of using digital assets (DA) called VoiceCard NFTs to store cloned voices of voiceover artists, which all information about royalties, commercial rights, and voice data are embedded inside. The combination of AI and Web 3.0 perfectly addresses the inefficiencies and accessibility issues in traditional voiceover industry, and complexity of commercial rights and ownership. Now, voiceover artists able to clone their voices and generate one-of-a-kind VoiceCard NFT collections with the VoiceLab AI Voice Engine, and receive voice royalties directly, together with the help of simple monetization tracking. Clients can freely explore the VoiceLab Marketplace, mint different VoiceCards which suits their use cases, and use them on-the-spot in the VoiceLab Studio for powerful and super natural AI speech generation via TTS (text-to-speech).

### ü•¥ What VoiceLab tackles?

One of the most critical components that cannot be disregarded when discussing content creation is voiceover. Voiceovers are widely-adopted, and they are utilized in a variety of industries to improve the quality of production. Nevertheless, the conventional voiceover process have major problems which need to be tackle:

- **Limited availability and high costs**: Finding the right voiceover artist can be challenging due to the limited number of professionals available. This scarcity can lead to delays in production and higher costs, especially when considering the fees for professional artists, studio time, editing, and post-production. These costs can quickly add up, making it a less viable option for smaller projects or businesses with limited budgets.

- **Quality inconsistency and lack of variation**: The quality of voiceovers can vary significantly between artists and even between recordings by the same artist. Additionally, there may be a limited range of voices and styles available, restricting the creative possibilities for content creators. This inconsistency and lack of variation can result in less engaging and professional audio content.

- **Multi-language challenge and difficulty in scaling**: When content needs to be produced in multiple languages, finding qualified voiceover artists who can deliver high-quality performances in each required language becomes a major hurdle. Scaling voiceover production to meet increasing demand is also difficult, as it requires coordinating with multiple artists, scheduling recording sessions, and ensuring consistent quality across a large volume of work.

- **Complex negotiations for commercial rights and time-consuming contract management**: Negotiating the commercial rights for voiceover work can be complex and time-consuming. Each project may require specific terms and conditions, leading to lengthy discussions and potential disagreements. Managing contracts for multiple voiceover projects involves considerable administrative work, including drafting, reviewing, and signing agreements, as well as ensuring compliance with all terms and conditions.

- **Royalties issues and challenges in tracking usage**: Handling royalty payments can be problematic, with potential disputes over the amounts owed, payment schedules, and the accurate tracking of usage. Ensuring that all parties receive fair compensation requires meticulous record-keeping and transparent processes. Keeping track of how and where voiceover content is used, and maintaining clear and accurate records, is a significant challenge. Without proper tracking, it can be difficult to enforce usage rights, distribute royalties correctly, and manage the overall lifecycle of the voiceover assets.
